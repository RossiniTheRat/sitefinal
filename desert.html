            The western diamondback (<em>Crotalus atrox</em>) is a member of the rattlesnake 
            species and is commonly found throughout the Southwest United States and the 
            Northern regions of Mexico. Rattlesnakes are venomous and get their name from the 
            rattling sound their tail makes when they feel threatened. Rattlesnakes will eat 
            small mammals, birds, lizards, amphibians, fish, and mice. They are also responsible 
            for many if not most snakebite fatalities in the United States as well as in 
            Northern Mexico.

        <p>
            The greater roadrunner (<em>Geococcyx californianus</em>) is a long-legged bird 
            native to the Southern United States. Roadrunners get their name from their ability 
            to run up to 20 miles per hour. Roadrunners usually live solitary lives until they 
            find a mate that they will stay with for life. They use their speed to help catch 
            their prey which consists of small insects, spiders, or even small mammals. Because 
            roadrunners live mostly in desert regions, they have evolved biological adaptations 
            to regulate their body temperature and reduce dehydration.

            The turkey vulture (<em>Cathartes aura</em>), spans most of America though they are 
            commonly found in hot dry areas where open areas are very close to woodlands. This 
            means that most of Southern California is the perfect climate for them. Turkey 
            vultures are scavengers and feed mostly on animal carcasses that they find using 
            their strong eyes and sense of smell. They also live in large community groups and 
            usually raise two chicks a year.
