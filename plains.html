                The American bison (<em>Bison bison</em>), otherwise known as the American buffalo or 
                just buffalo, is native to North American grasslands. Before settlers came to 
                America bison roamed in large herds all across North America and had a total 
                population of 60 million. In 1889 the bison population had dwindled to 541 
                because of hunting, and today their population is around 31,000 thanks to 
                recovery efforts. Many Native American tribes considered bison to be sacred 
                animals that held religious value.

                The Prairie dog (<em>Cynomys ludovicianus</em>), is a herbivorous burrowing 
                ground squirrel that can be found in the plains of North America. Here in 
                Lubbock, you can find the black-tailed prairie dog. Prairie dogs make their 
                homes by digging burrows that can be 33 feet long and go down almost 10 feet 
                underground. Prairie dogs are said to be highly social, and they live in large 
                colonies that can span hundreds of acres. When threatened a prairie dog will 
                make a high-pitched call to alert other prairie dogs in the area of the danger.

                The Pronghorn (<em>Antilocapra americana</em>), which is indigenous to central 
                North America, is the only surviving member of the family Antilocarpa. Long ago, 
                during the Pleistocene epoch, there were 11 other species that the pronghorn 
                shared a family with. Interestingly, the pronghorns prefer to form mixed-sex 
                herds during the winter only to break up in spring into groups of young males 
                and harems of females, with adult males venturing off to live alone. Like the 
                buffalo, the pronghorn thrived and had a large population until European 
                settlers arrived and began hunting the animal. Pronghorns also play a role in 
                Native American mythology and oral history.
